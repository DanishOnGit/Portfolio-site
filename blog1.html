         <p><small>27th Nov,2020 |3 min read</small><br><br>All websites we visit have a domain name. There is one part of it which we all are familiar with, the <strong>'.com'</strong>. What is with '.com' that makes it so much popular? Should all websites go for a '.com'? Is not having a '.com' disadvantageous?<br><br><strong>This article focuses on such questions around the '.com'.</strong><br>
            Keep reading.</p>
            <h2>What is a TLD?</h2>
            <p>A top-level domain (TLD) is the last segment of a domain name, i.e. the element located after the last dot. It is also known as a 'domain suffix' or 'URL extension'.
            Let us understand with an example domain name-<br>
            <strong>store.mywebsite.com</strong>
            <ul style="text-align: left;">
                <li><strong>store</strong>- is the sub domain</li>
                <li><strong>mywebsite</strong>- is the second-level domain</li>
                <li><strong>com</strong>- is the top-level domain</li>
            </ul></p>
           <p> A TLD can help you identify the purpose of a website or even the geographic location. In the above example, .com shows that the site is a commercial site.</p><p>You can read more about TLDs <a href="https://www.hostinger.in/tutorials/what-is-tld" style="text-decoration: none;">HERE.</a></p><p>There are a numerous TLDs to choose from for your domain name, but .com remains the most popular for most users.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Let's see.</p>
           <h2>Reasons for the popularity of '.com'.</h2>
           <ol style="padding-inline-start:30px; text-align: left;">
               <li><strong>It is important for branding and authority:</strong>If you can get it, then get it. The reason the giants have the .com is because it is necessary to demonstrate authority, longevity and trust.</li><br>
               <li><strong> It's one of the earliest TLDs:</strong>The .com domain extension has been synonymous with the internet since the “dot-com bubble” in the late 1990s. Over 45% of all registered domain names are .com domains. A lot of other TLDs are too recent to catch up.</li><br>
               <li><strong> Better click-through rate:</strong>If you search for some information on google and you see one website with a .com and another with a .net or .biz, which one do you choose to click on? Assuming you know nothing about both websites, you are more likely to click on the website with the .com version.</li><br>
               <li><strong> Better resale value:</strong>Buying a .com is an investment too. Yes! You read that right. Resale value of .com is 5x-100x higher than any equivalent keyword with a different extension! Especially if it's a catchy combination of words.</li><br>
               <li><strong> It's a blank canvas:</strong>Having a .com gives a business the widest range of branding options. Building on, say, .pizza or .club imposes certain limits on brand identity.</li>
           </ol>
           <p>Hence, the .com still remains the most popular among all TLDs though its availability is limited and can turn out to be extremely expensive in certain cases.</p>
